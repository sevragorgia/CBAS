Preliminary remarks
-------------------

The common blue aquarium sponge is a cyanosponge commonly found in salt water aquaria. Most aquarium hobbiest refer to it as *Collospongia auris*, however its taxonomic affiliation is not clear. I refer to this sponge as the "Common Blue Aquarium Sponge", **CBAS** in short. CBAS is a cyanosponge, it harbours cyanobacteria from the Candidatus *Synechococcus spongiarum* clade.

Culture of the sponge under different light conditions resulted in the observation that when kept under dark conditions the sponge bleaches, turning completely white after ca. 12 weeks under darkness; the "normal" color of the sponge varies between green, blue and violet. Changes in color are accompanied by changes in size and general morphology. For instance, the sponges form elongated projections; the normal shape of the sponge is lobated and plate like.

It is not clear whether the cyanobacteria are still present in the bleached sponge tissues. Bioanalyzer profiles of RNA extracts from bleached sponges clearly showed that the samples lack the rRNA bands belonging the cyanobacteria but qPCR experiments pointed towards the presence of cyanobacteria in DNA extracts from sponges exposed to max. 6 weeeks darkeness [1]. However, this evidence is (in my opinion) not conclusive due to a number of technical problems associated to these experiments; RNA extractions only demonstrate that the symbionts are not active and the qPCR experiments suffered from incosistent amplifying of the samples. Another piece of evidence (weakly) pointing towards this is the capacity of the sponges to regain color after 8-12 weeks re-exposure to light; symbiont uptake from the water column cannot be excluded, however, apparently *S. spongiarum* is not present in the water. All in all, the evidence at hand point to the presence of the symbionts in some kind of inactive (transcriptionl/metabolic) state in the sponge tissues exposed to dark conditions.

Study rational
--------------

Since it is possible to manipulate the trascriptional/metabolic state of the cyanobacterial symbionts through the exposure of the system to darkness, CBAS represents an interesting system to assess how the sponge reacts to symbiont inactivation. I use RNA-Seq data to *de novo* assemble a reference transcriptome for this system and to assess changes in the sponge gene expression profiles associated with different symbiont transcriptional states. I hope these data contributes to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms used by sponges to interact with their microbiomes.

Materials and Methods
=====================

Sponge culture
--------------

Sponges are kept in a 200L salt water aquarium under a 12hr light:12hr darkness regime using two T5 fluorescent lights. For all experiments one large sponge was used and a hole-puncher was used to produce explants of 10 mm diameter [2]. The explants were place in a recipient with sand and were allow to recover for 3-5 days under control light conditions. Recovery was visually assesed by inspecting the border of the explants to corroborate the tissue healed at the cutting points. After this, the explants were moved to a section of the aquarium covered with a two sheets of black plastic cloth. The plastic cloth serves to block the light from the T5 lights; the amount of light (in klux) penetrating the plastic sheets was \~0 klux while under normal conditions at least \~15 klux can be measured at the water surface.

[1] I have (repeatedly) failed to prepare libraries for Next Generation Sequencing from bleached tissue, probably due to the presence of secondary metabolites in the extracts.
